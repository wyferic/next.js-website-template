This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) boilerplate code hosted on github pages. 
This is for my personal use since I cannot for the life of me remember how to code.

In case something goes wrong, consult the sacred texts: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-deploy-next-js-app-to-github-pages/

## Getting Started
Step 1: clone the repo

```git clone https://github.com/wyferic/next.js-website-template.git```

Step 2: install the modules

```npm install```

Step 3: run the thing

```npm run dev```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

You can see the (hopefully) working boilerplate code here:
